**In this project I built a machine learning model to analyze thousands of reviews on amazon echo product, so that Customer sentiment is predicted and know whether customers are happy with the product or not** 

*Starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization** , down the line I used **Text Data Cleaning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Tokenization** to prepare the data for **Sentiment analysis**. I Used **Naive Bayes Classifier** to perform the sentiment analysis and **Logistic regression model** to improve the scores.*
